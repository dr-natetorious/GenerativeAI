Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architectures cross-train a generator and discriminator network to create and score content. Mirka et al. (2022) improved Network-On -Chip (NoC) power efficiency by 24% by creating a Multi-Reward Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (M-RWGAN) model.

> Despite the excitement and enthusiasm surrounding generative AI, effective use of these tools requires an understanding of their foundation models. To accomplish this, dedicated interdisciplinary groups are being formed to advance the science  of  foundation  models  through  evaluating  biases, identifying limitations, providing transparency, and forecasting misuse before deployment at scale.

## Technology With Endless Possibilities (2023)

Generative AI - A Technology With Endless Possibilities. (2023, February 3). Business World. [EndlessPossible](EndlessPossible.pdf).

As per Gartner, Generative AI is expected to change, among other things, digital product development. It will increase the quality, performance, and accessibility of digital products while reducing their time to market. This is among the many commercial benefits of Generative AI, apart from its sheer magical quality. Gartner predicts that:

- "by 2025, Generative AI will be producing 10 per cent of all data (now it's less than one per cent) with 20 per cent of all test data for consumer-facing use cases.
- "by 2025, 30 per cent of outbound messages from large organisations will be synthetically generated.
- "by 2025, Generative AI will be used by 50 per cent of drug discovery and development initiatives.
- "by 2027, 30 per cent of manufacturers will use Generative AI to enhance their product development effectiveness

### What additional use cases will exist

Some Use Cases of Generative AI:

- Image Generation - creation of new, realistic images from a dataset of existing images and or text.
- Image-to-image translation - conversion of one image into another, be it style transfer, sketch-to-image or image-to-sketch.
- Image & Video resolution enhancement.
- Audio/Video Generation - useful for voice overs, new music creation, gameplay, etc.
- Text-to-speech - this is done using GANs, wherein the discriminator network functions as a trainer for modulation, intonation, etc.
- Text Generation - useful for commercials, news headlines, dialogues, movie sub-titles.
- Code Generation - useful in software development to produce code without manual intervention.
- Generative AI applications can be beneficial in healthcare, media, education, engineering design. They also have application in the creative field for artists and musicians.

The researchers 11 Korean teachers ChatGPT for improving their English classes. They used it for playing games, creating lesson plans, correcting 

## Intelligent Vehicles (2023)

## Traffic Transformer (2020)

Cai, L., Janowicz, K., Mai, G., Yan, B., & Zhu, R. (2020). Traffic transformer: Capturing the continuity and periodicity of time series for traffic forecasting. Transactions in GIS, 24(3), 736–755. https://doi.org/10.1111/tgis.12644. [TrafficTransformer](TrafficTransformer.pdf).

Cai et al. (2020) described the challenges with traffic forecasting patterns due to the spatiotemporal dependencies within the dataset. For instance, there’s more traffic Monday morning than Sunday night. The authors demonstrate that traditional strategies using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are insufficient and propose a transformer-based architecture. RNNs miss the mark because they cannot integrate temporal dependencies such as a parade or accident occurring. The authors also examine the challenges and limitations of existing state-of-the-art solutions, such as combining Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and Graph Neural Networks (GNN). These technologies can integrate with traditional RNN models to extract information from images and video (CNN), model those transitions (GNN), and account for seasonality (RNN).

Instead, Cai et al. chose a transformer architecture with a Graph Convolution Network (GCN) encoder/decoder to represent spatial dependencies of the traffic. They demonstrated the flexibility of transformer-based to handle spatiotemporal information and make efficient predictions.

## Scheduling Construction Projects (2023)

Prieto, S. A., Mengiste, E. T., & García de Soto, B. (2023). Investigating the Use of ChatGPT for the Scheduling of Construction Projects. Buildings (2075-5309), 13(4), 857. https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings13040857. [SchedulingConstruction](SchedulingConstruction.pdf).

The researchers used ChatGPT to create construction project scheduling estimates. They found that it was reasonable in terms of structure but has some challenges. For instance, there's guardrails with ChatGPT that prevent it talking about money and pricing estimates. This made the responses generic and vague. 

- The researchers call out the need for chatbots providing support on construction sites. 

- Another use case is to integrate emailed change requests into scheduling tools like Microsoft Project. Their goal is to streamline the customer requesting an alteration and it automatically reflects in the bill of materials and employee scheduling. These capabilities are particularly useful for blue collar roles which lack the training and find administrative tasks tedious/undifferentiating.
